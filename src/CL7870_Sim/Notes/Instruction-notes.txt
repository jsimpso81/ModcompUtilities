For the instructions using R1 + instruction & 0x000f
	it seems like wrap around is allowed.
	based on the MC II diag 1 results

	I thought it would issue a system protect trap, or
	UIT trap, but it doesn't seem to.

	actually the manual talks about memory wrap around!!!

I temporarilly allowed non-priv halt.  Does priv bit stay on
	when in an interrupt regardless of PSW stored in
	memory.  Otherwise a 0 psw stored in mem would 
	cause a continuous halt instruction...

	books says always priv if not virtual!

TODO I/O instructions (except ISZ?) are privileged.
