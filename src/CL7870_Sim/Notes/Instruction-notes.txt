For the instructions using R1 + instruction & 0x000f
	it seems like wrap around is allowed.
	based on the MC II diag 1 results

	I thought it would issue a system protect trap, or
	UIT trap, but it doesn't seem to.

	actually the manual talks about memory wrap around!!!

I temporarilly allowed non-priv halt.  Does priv bit stay on
	when in an interrupt regardless of PSW stored in
	memory.  Otherwise a 0 psw stored in mem would 
	cause a continuous halt instruction...

	books says always priv if not virtual!

TODO I/O instructions (except ISZ?) are privileged.


subtract overflow definition ----

	Set if operands were of opposite sign and the sign of the
	subtrahend was the same as the sign of the result, otherwise
	cleared   (subtrahend is the value being subtracted.)

SAL 
	loads and runs.   First thing typed in always gets KEY ERROR.
	think this is related to buffering....
	version is K.3

DAX
	it seems to load... but never displays anything on the screen.
	it processes a lot of REX calls, also clock is enabled, as
	well as C,D,E,F.  
	CI seems to be ignored.
	maybe it is expecting console to use interrupts....

Classic II memory 3695/3696 diag
	loads.  wants console switches set....
	set switches and press . (several times), nothing happens.

Classic II CPU diag 1
	loads and halts at 0x0119 ????

	Loads and runs
	first char entered is always bad...

modcomp II diags 1

	ADR	overflow fails ??  -- this should be implemented.
	SUR	overflow fails ??  -- this should be implemented.


modcomp II diags 2
	0206 LAS,2,4 overflow error -- NOT IMPLEMENTED.
	0233 LAD,1,1 overflow error -- NOT IMPLEMENTED.
	CRMB, CRXB, CRSB, CBMB errors

modcomp II diags 3
	loads
	displays messages
	doesn't wait 30 seconds (is it using the clock or just instruction timing...)
	int 6 (clock) is not enabled...
	TEST 1,2
	DAR error.... continuously?
