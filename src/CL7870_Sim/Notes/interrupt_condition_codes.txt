protection trap condition codes

	n z o c

	0 0 0 0
	0 0 0 1
	0 0 1 0

	0 x x x		system stall alarm (ambiguous!!)
	
	0 1 x x		priv instuction trap

	1 0 0 0		virt mode instruction read violation
	1 0 0 1		virt mode instruction write violation
	1 0 1 0		virt mode operand read violation
	1 0 1 1		virt mode operand write violation

	1 1 0 0		extended mode instruction read violation
	1 1 0 1		extended mode instruction write violation
	1 1 1 0		extended mode operand read violation
	1 1 1 1		extended mode operand write violation
	

unimplemented instruction trap

	n z o c
	x 0 0 x		not rex, not exr/exi
	x 0 1 x		not reg, exr/exi
	x 1 0 x		rex, not exr/exi
	x 1 1 x		rex, exi/exr


powerfail auto/restart trap condition codes

	n z o c
	0 0 0 x		external user, power recovering, DC power change
	0 0 1 x		external user, power recovering, AC power change
	0 1 0 x		external user, power failing, DC power change
	0 1 1 x		external user, power failing, AC power change

	1 0 0 x		local, power recovering, DC power change
	1 0 1 x		local, power recovering, AC power change
	1 1 0 x		local, power failing, DC power change
	1 1 1 x		local, power failing, AC power change


memory parity trap condition codes

	n z o c
	0 x 0 0		global - pc points to next instruction, err in inst but not opcode
	0 x 0 1		"", error in opcode
	0 x 1 0		"", err in operand
	0 x 1 1		"", undefined

	0 x 0 0		instruction abort, pc points to aborted instruction, err in inst but not opcode
	0 x 0 1		"", error in opcode
	0 x 1 0		"", err in operand
	0 x 1 1		"", undefined
