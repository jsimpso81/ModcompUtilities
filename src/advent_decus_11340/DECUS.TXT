Abstract: Adventure is a magical, unpredictable, and often
addicting computer game that has caught on in the United
States in near epidemic proportions.
 
It is a treasure hunt with all the trimmings-mysteries
and challenges that grow more and more complex as the
game unravels. Adventure is more of a puzzle than a
game. Once solved, it's mastered. The mastering,
however, often takes months of drawing maps and planning
strategy.
 
Adventure's sweeping popularity lies in its power to
enchant. Players are projected into a world of fantasy,
one that blends the heart-pounding suspense of Treasure
Island with the magic of Alice in Wonderland.
 
Notes: Improved user interface; improved documentation.
Adventure has been successfully run on an LSI-11/03 and
an LSI-11/23. RT-11 V3/FORTRAN IV V2 gave one warning
when compiling AMAIN.FOR for possible modification of DO
loop parameter "HINT". Ignoring this message caused
no problems.
